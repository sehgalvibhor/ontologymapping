  headline: Overview
  content: "<p>Echocardiogram (also known as cardiac ultrasound) is the single highest-volume
    cardiac imaging test practiced in millions of hospitals worldwide. There are numerous
    guidelines documents on what and how to measure heart anatomy and function in
    an echocardiogram. This has led to different hospitals, medical professionals
    and patients, speaking a different language when it comes to communicating ECHO
    results. Harmonization of reports is needed not just to directly improve clinical
    communications, but also to leverage the ontology labels in pursuit of advanced
    machine learning on cardiac ultrasound imaging. We propose a hierarchical ontology
    mapping model that can map free-text in ECHO reports to a standardized ontology.
    This model is exposed to the medical community as a web application that allows
    users to upload ECHO reports and extract a standardized representation of their
    input.</p>"

    The Design Blocks can be used without Forestry but to harness the power
    of Blocks we recommend using <a href="https://forestry.io">Forestry</a>. Once the site is imported you can immediately
    create new sites and make them fully customizable.
