  headline: Overview
  content: Next to Chest X-ray, Echocardiogram (also known as cardiac ultrasound)
    is the single highest-volume cardiac imaging test practiced in millions of hospitals
    worldwide. There are numerous guidelines documents on what and how to measure
    heart anatomy and function in an echocardiogram. This has led to different hospitals,
    medical professionals and patients, speaking a different language when it comes
    to communicating ECHO results. Harmonization of reports is needed not just to
    directly improve clinical communications, but also to leverage the ontology labels
    in pursuit of advanced machine learning on cardiac ultrasound imaging. We propose
    a hierarchical ontology mapping model that can map free-text in ECHO reports to
    a standardized ontology. This model is exposed to the medical community as a web
    application that allows users to upload ECHO reports and extract a standardized
    representation of their input.
